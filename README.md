# Covid-19-Analysis
This project analyzes and visualizes the impact (deaths,
recoveries, confirmed cases) caused by the novel corona virus using R programming. 
We can analyze the statistics of the pandemic day by day, month by month, region by region. We can 
visualize these statistics graphically (both linear and log) and we can 
also visualize the number of covid-19 cases in each and every country in a world map.
This project is done only for educational purposes. I have also attached the report for reference.
